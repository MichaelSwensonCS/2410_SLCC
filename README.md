# 2410_SLCC
Final project...Example of a headless 2 weeks sprint (Note: Currently only controller functionality) XNA


My first experience manipulating sprites and collision. Art is copied from Castlevania Bloodlines, Splatterhouse 3 and Steven Swenson.
Demonstrates timers, C# Linq manipulation, method over loading, and XNA library knowledge.
